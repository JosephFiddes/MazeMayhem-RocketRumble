# MazeMayhem-RocketRumble
Source code for "Maze Mayhem! Rocket Rumble!", submitted to the Game Maker's Toolkit game jam 2021!

I haven't actually checked to make sure that this will work when downloaded.  
In order to actually use the scripts and stuff, Unity needs to be installed.  

To open, navigate to Assets/Scenes and open SampleScene.unity or GameOver.unity.
